TinyPNG client for Mac


This is a client of TinyPNG for Mac, with which you can compress pngs without open browser and just drag and drop.

### Usage

1. Regist a KEY using your email at [link](https://tinypng.com/developers/subscription). You can also do this from Client since there is a button on the window.
2. Paste your key to window. (Just need for first use)
3. Drag images to the receiver and drop them.

### Download

Check "Anywhere" if you can not open this app. Just for the first time, and I suggest you uncheck it after you open this app for security.
